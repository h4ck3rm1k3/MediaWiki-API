Revision history for MediaWiki-API

0.12    2008-07-30
        I shouldn't rush things. Removed a debug line I left in.

0.11    2008-07-30
        Fixed a big bug where I was returning a failure when getting edit tokens if the page didn't
        exist. This certainly doesn't make sense when you are creating a page! The consequences were
        it was actually impossible to create a new page.
        Thanks to Stuart Caie for the patch. 

0.10    2008-07-14
        Some fixes to documentation examples (Were not updated after some changes in the interface).

0.09    2008-07-13
        Automatically encode API parameter values to utf-8.

0.08    2008-06-30
        A lot of releases for one day I know. Minor stuff again, but some dependencies had been left out
        of the makefile which mean't the module was failing some automatic testing. Also made the config
        options a bit more clear in the documentation.

0.07    2008-06-30
        Fixed a bug in some of the example code which was written when using XML::Simple (which meant
        a lightly different returned hash structure).

0.06    2008-06-30
        Fixed documentation to pass pod test.

0.05    2008-06-29
        Various code cleanups and fixes. Documentation improvements. Addition of download function.

0.04    2008-06-27
        Switched to json api and JSON::XS module. Faster than using XML. Added GZIP header/support.

0.03    2008-06-18
        First version. Includes some documentation for functions and probably lots of bugs.
