        My understanding on the way rollback worked was flawed. The rollback call always rolled back the last users edit 
        for a page, whereas it should only rollback "the requested" users edits if they were the last editor for a page.
        This is now fixed. The timestamp code for editing was also broken. By default the edit call will not handle any 
        conflicts for you. When you get the contents of a page, you should save the timestamp and pass this back to the
        edit call, which will give you an error if someone else had edited the page in the meantime (or at least if their
        edit has caused a conflict)

        Big thanks to Steve Sanbeg for help/support/patches and bringing these problems to my attention.

        Licensed the code under GPL v3.

        Added support for maxlag (see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Maxlag_parameter). This is
        controlled with configuration options 'max_lag', 'max_lag_retries' and 'max_lag_delay'.

        There are two more configuration options to deal with http or connection problems. These are 'retries' and
        'retry_delay'.

        There is an additional error field now {error}->{stacktrace) which contains a Carp stacktrace
        to aid with debugging.

        For help on using these new configuration parameters please see the documentation.

        Thanks to Dan Collins for the maxlag suggestion/report.

0.15    2008-10-12
        Internal test release with some new options.

0.14    2008-09-21
        Module now traps and reports errors with the JSON decoding. This helps if for some reason
        api.php returns an error (such as a PHP error) rather than JSON formatted data. Thanks to Steve
        Sanbeg for this patch.

0.13    2008-08-10
        As requested by Kjell, an option has been added to the api call to skip encoding of parameters
        to utf-8.

0.12    2008-07-30
        I shouldn't rush things. Removed a debug line I left in.

0.11    2008-07-30
        Fixed a big bug where I was returning a failure when getting edit tokens if the page didn't
        exist. This certainly doesn't make sense when you are creating a page! The consequences were
        it was actually impossible to create a new page.
        Thanks to Stuart Caie for the patch. 

0.10    2008-07-14
        Some fixes to documentation examples (Were not updated after some changes in the interface).

0.09    2008-07-13
        Automatically encode API parameter values to utf-8.

0.08    2008-06-30
        A lot of releases for one day I know. Minor stuff again, but some dependencies had been left out
        of the makefile which mean't the module was failing some automatic testing. Also made the config
        options a bit more clear in the documentation.

0.07    2008-06-30
        Fixed a bug in some of the example code which was written when using XML::Simple (which meant
        a lightly different returned hash structure).

0.06    2008-06-30
        Fixed documentation to pass pod test.

0.05    2008-06-29
        Various code cleanups and fixes. Documentation improvements. Addition of download function.

0.04    2008-06-27
        Switched to json api and JSON::XS module. Faster than using XML. Added GZIP header/support.

0.03    2008-06-18
        First version. Includes some documentation for functions and probably lots of bugs.
